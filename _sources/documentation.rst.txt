This series of notebooks are meant to illustrate the different features of the
*pyActigraphy* package:

* `a gentle introduction to the basic functionalities`_
* how to discard invalid sequences in actigraphy recordings before analysis:

  * `Invalid sequences during the recordings`_
  * `Invalid sequences at the beginning and/or the end of the recordings`_

* `how to calculate the usual rest-activity rhythm variables`_
* `how to visualise sleep diaries and compute summary statistics`_
* `how to detect rest periods automatically`_
* `how to quantify sleep fragmentation using state transition probabilities`_
